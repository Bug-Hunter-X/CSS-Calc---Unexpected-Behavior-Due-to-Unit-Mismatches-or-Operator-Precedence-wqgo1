The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results occur due to unit mismatches or operator precedence issues. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works correctly, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will cause unexpected behavior because of the missing 'px' unit.  Another example is `height: calc(20px + 10px * 2);` which might not calculate as expected due to standard order of operations (multiplication before addition).
